# Python 

## Purpose 
This repository lists all of my completed submissions on [codewars](https://www.codewars.com).
All submissions will be written in the language that I am focusing on, which 
is Python. 

## Influences
Two resources that influence how I program are 
- [The Python Apprentice](https://leanpub.com/python-apprentice)
- [Clean Code: Writing Code for Humans](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/writing-clean-code-humans/table-of-contents)

## Feedback
I began my programming journey in April 2020, starting with [C](https://cs50.harvard.edu/summer/2020/). 
I have shifted my attention to python starting in June 2020. Any constructive feedback is welcomed.
